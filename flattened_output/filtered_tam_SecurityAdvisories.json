        "Description": "On January 3, 2018, researchers disclosed three vulnerabilities that take advantage of the implementation of speculative execution of instructions on many modern microprocessor architectures to perform side-channel information disclosure attacks. These vulnerabilities could allow an unprivileged local attacker, in specific circumstances, to read privileged memory belonging to other processes or memory allocated to the operating system kernel.\n\n The first two vulnerabilities, CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715, are collectively known as Spectre. The third vulnerability, CVE-2017-5754, is known as Meltdown. The vulnerabilities are all variants of the same attack and differ in the way that speculative execution is exploited.\n\n To exploit any of these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be able to run crafted code on an affected device. Although the underlying CPU and operating system combination in a product or service may be affected by these vulnerabilities, the majority of Cisco products are closed systems that do not allow customers to run custom code and are, therefore, not vulnerable. There is no vector to exploit them. Cisco products are considered potentially vulnerable only if they allow customers to execute custom code side-by-side with Cisco code on the same microprocessor.\n\n A Cisco product that may be deployed as a virtual machine or a container, even while not directly affected by any of these vulnerabilities, could be targeted by such attacks if the hosting environment is vulnerable. Cisco recommends that customers harden their virtual environments, tightly control user access, and ensure that all security updates are installed. Customers who are deploying products as a virtual device in multi-tenant hosting environments should ensure\n that the underlying hardware, as well as operating system or hypervisor, is patched against the vulnerabilities in question.\n\n",

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet to an interface of an affected device and having an authenticated user retrieve LLDP statistics from the affected device through CLI show commands or Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) requests. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the LLDP service to crash and stop running on the affected device. In certain situations, the LLDP crash may result in a reload of the affected device.\n\n**Note:** LLDP is a Layer 2 link protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be directly connected to an interface of an affected device, either physically or logically (for example, through a Layer 2 Tunnel configured to transport the LLDP protocol).\n\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\n**Determine the Status of LLDP on Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects**\n\nThe LLDP feature is enabled by default on Cisco UCS 6200, 6300, 6400, and 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects and cannot be fully disabled. LLDP is always enabled on the following interfaces:\n\n- Ethernet uplink ports (network interfaces that connect to upstream switches for network connectivity)\n- Ethernet port channel members\n- Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) uplink ports\n- Management interface (mgmt0)\n\nLLDP may also be enabled on server ports (interfaces that are presented to the servers in the Cisco UCS Manager domain) and appliance ports (interfaces that connect to directly attached NFS storage) through a network control policy. Additional information is available in the Configuring Network Control Policies section of the [Cisco UCS Manager Network Management Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/unified_computing/ucs/ucs-manager/GUI-User-Guides/Network-Mgmt/4-3/b_UCSM_Network_Mgmt_Guide_4_3/b_UCSM_Network_Mgmt_Guide_chapter_01010.html#d20481e10246a1635)\n\nTo determine the status of LLDP on a specific interface, use the connect nxos command at the device CLI, then use the show lldp interface ethernet module/interface command. If the enable (rx) status is set to Y, the interface accepts incoming LLDP packets, as shown in the following example:\n\n###################################################################################################\nFI-A# show lldp interface ethernet 1/1/1\nInterface Information:\n   Enable (tx/rx/dcbx): Y/Y/Y    Port Mac address: 00:c8:8b:84:a2:54\n###################################################################################################\n\n",
